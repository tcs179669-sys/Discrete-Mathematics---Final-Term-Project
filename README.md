# Discrete-Mathematics---Final-Term-Project
This project showcases real-world applications of concepts from Number Theory and Cryptography (Discrete Mathematics - Rosen) by implementing a Basic Cryptography Suite, within which Caeser Cipher, Affine Cipher and a simple RSA system is shown.
In order to implement the workings of this project, you need a MinGW compiler, VSC with cpp extensions and basic libraries (iostream, string etc), or CMD. 
In order for this to work correctly, input must be of a specefic type, memtioned in the code's running, other wise the program will show error and keep prompting for input.
